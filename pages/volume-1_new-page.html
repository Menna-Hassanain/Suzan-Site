                <p><small>This is a diary. I don't really see the point of this,
                    but now that I've written in it I can't return the notebook. Oh, well.<br>
                    The weather's<em>lovely</em> outside. So, I'm going on a walk later.</small></p>

                <p> The grocery list:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Sesame seeds, croissants, danishes, coco powder, and brown sugar.</li>
                        <li> Strawberries, blackberres, bananas, and apples.</li>
                        <li> Sweet corn, tomatoes, and beets.</li>

            <br>
            <h1> Chapter 3</h1>
            <p> I'm writing this hesitantly but since the point of a diary
                is for "personal use," no one else will read it--A man from the flee market
                was giving me quick glances from the booth next to me. <br>
                Shades of red flushed his cheeks as he shys his gaze from mine, such a dreamboat. I saw him 
                early this morning when I ran errands. This indirect interaction filled 
                me with so much curiosity now. Should I ask him if he wants to go 
                apple-picking with me next Saturday? Is this... Too forward? I'm suppose I won't
                be seeing him around.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1> Chapter 4</h1>
            <p> It's a funny thing--trying to remember what I'm writing this for, and stuffing ths diary behind my
                pillow every night--I've been writing every now and then and I'm already used to the practice.
                <br> I went out shopping with the girls on Monday, helped Ma with the house on Tuesday, Pa took me
                to Orientation Day on Wednesday, and I helped Angie meal-prep (Friday evening) for the cookout tomorrow.
                So much to do in such a short time... Things feel a little hectic as of late, but they're good things,
                nevertheless. The only thing I'm unsure about is university. Pa may have taken me to Orientation Day, but
                Ma's already got me a handful of suitors lined-up for me. Half of my friend group have already enrolled in
                reputable schools, and the other half are engaged. Judy, who is only a year younger than me, is expecting
                her first child with her husband, Michael. It looks like they know what they want and are set for
                life, meanwhile I'm still indecisive. See, Ma believes I'm responsible enough to carry a household on my back
                and can make a good wife, but Pa believes that education must come first before marriage. Am I ready
                for marriage? Yes, but if I choose that before education, it almost feels like a cop-out from a challenge
                that awaits me in university. Yet, from what I hear, people get engaged or married <em>while</em>
                they pursue their studies as well. So, does it even matter<em>when</em>I'm ready to tie the knot? The
                guy from the flea market randomly crossed my mind when Angie and I went to buy the ingredients for the
                cookout. The thought of having a second encounter in the same situation made sense to me, but only for
                a moment. Life doesn't work that way, though.
                <br><br>Oh, lord! My fingers are cramping. This is the longest I've ever written in a notebook. I'll
                call it a night. Hopefully I get things figured out soon!
