                <h1>The Story</h1>
                <p>"The Diary," or simply "Suzan" is a web project about a young woman's attempts at writing a diary.
                    The timeline spans from her gap-year after high-school till spring break of senior college.
                    Suzan's goal is to pour her heart out whenever she gets the chance to write, but she often dwells
                    on how<em>much</em> she should write and talk about her daily life. Join Suzan's diary-writing
                    journey as she opens up about her life and learns how to express herself with ink.</p>
