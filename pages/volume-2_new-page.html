    <h1> Chapter 1</h1>
    <p> It's the middle of sophomore college; I'm finally home for winter break. Wow~ It's
        been<em>forever</em>since I last touched this diary. A lot has happened for the past
        three years! I believe writing about the experience thus far would fill up some of
        these blank pages. But to save my hand from cramping after writing countless essays
        for English 204-002, I'll keep it short and easy to digest. I enrolled to Michigan
        State University, MSU for short. I moved into a dormatory, an experience much like
        boarding school. I made sure I stayed in touch with my friends and family while I
        was away. Angie goes to MSU as well, but I could barely meet her because of the
        time conflict with our schedules. Judy's doing great for herself now. Her 2-year old
        daughter, Delilah, is as cute as a button. Michael teaches elementary history at a nearby
        school, and earns quite a handsome paycheck. Those who got engaged in my friend group,
        two ended up breaking off the engagement and worked at diners, and the other three are
        budgeting their wedding ceremonies. Those who enrolled before I did are actively looking
        for high-earning 9-to-5 jobs to pay off debt... I shouldn't make fun of it, because
        I'll be up next. Pa argues that he ought to pay off my loans till I tie the knot with
        Samuel, a Canadian with a touch of French. Ma introduced me to him from her network,<em>
        and she</em> argues that <em>I</em> should pay it off since I signed up for higher
        eduction. I understand both of their perspectives, and I'm determined to find a job to
        help Pa out with the finances... We'll see by the end of senior college.
        <br> I still don't know what I should major in. I excel core courses like English,
        history, and algebra. I'm average at complicated sciences like chemistry and astronomy,
        but I can digest biology just fine. I'm thinking the easiest route to go is to become
        a teacher myself, but that's not me. Suzan loves a challenge, eh? But, a challenge for
        life?? That's quite a predicament, so I have to really sit and think about it.

            <p> This is a strange-looking leaf. For the 8th time... It's<em>supposed to be</em>
                a different color.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The "purple" shamrock (Oxalis triangularis) is a flowering perennial plant with
                triangular dark "purple" leaves. The "purple" shamrock (also called "purple" clover)
                grows as a low-growing foliage plant in gardens or as an attractive potted houseplant.
                Other names for this "purple-leafed" plant include Love plant, "purple" butterfly
                plant,false shamrock or "purple" Oxalis. Due to the distinctive shape of the leaves
                and its dark "purple" almost black color, it is a stunning indoor plant for a sunny
                spot in your house.</p>
