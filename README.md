# Suzan-Site

This is a project made for a class (GDES 308: Web Design). "Suzan" isn't meant to delevop after class is out of session, unless gaps need to be filled to create a "complete" site. If you liked the project and would like to see more, you can find the artist in the following social media platforms!
